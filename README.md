# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Dashboard

## 1. Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an advanced, interactive Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard using Tableau to track, analyze, and optimize hotel performance across key operational and revenue metrics. The dashboard will consolidate multi-dimensional hotel data—including bookings, revenue streams, visitor demographics, and ratings—into a single, cohesive, and visually compelling interface . The primary goal is to empower management to quickly identify high-value visitor segments, optimize room type allocation, enhance marketing through channel performance analysis, and diagnose seasonal revenue fluctuations to maximize occupancy and overall revenue per available room (RevPAR).
