# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Dashboard

## 1. Executive Summary
This project aims to develop an advanced, interactive Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard using Tableau to track, analyze, and optimize hotel performance across key operational and revenue metrics. The dashboard will consolidate multi-dimensional hotel data—including bookings, revenue streams, visitor demographics, and ratings—into a single, cohesive, and visually compelling interface . The primary goal is to empower management to quickly identify high-value visitor segments, optimize room type allocation, enhance marketing through channel performance analysis, and diagnose seasonal revenue fluctuations to maximize occupancy and overall revenue per available room (RevPAR).

## 2. Problem Statement
Background:  
While significant data is generated from hotel booking systems, the management team currently lacks a single, integrated tool for a comprehensive, real-time view of performance. Key information is fragmented across multiple reports, making it difficult to connect visitor volume to revenue, or channel performance to room type popularity.  

Objective:  
To create a dynamic, single-source-of-truth dashboard in Tableau that clearly isolates key performance drivers and bottlenecks, such as:  
● Identifying the most profitable room types and booking channels.  
● Understanding visitor volume and ratings by country to optimize targeted marketing efforts.  
● Pinpointing time-based trends for forecasting and dynamic pricing strategies.    

Scope:  
The dashboard will be scoped to include analyses of the hotel booking data, as demonstrated in the provided image . Key analyses include:  
● Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Average Rating, Total Revenue, and Total Guests .  
● Revenue Generation: Revenue by Booking Channel and Revenue by Room Type .  
● Geographic Analysis: Revenue, Ratings, and Visitor Volume by Country .  
● Time-Based Analysis: Revenue Generated over Time (Q1, Q2, Q3 trends) .  
● Room Performance: Number of Visitors for various Room Types (Double, Single, Suite) .
